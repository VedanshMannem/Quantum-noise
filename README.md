Creating quantum noise:

This project exploits the breakdown region of a zener diode to hear the quantum tunneling of electrons. Zener diodes are doped very specifically to have a thin energy barrier so this allows for quantum tunneling when the voltage is very close to the rating of the diode. 

After building the circuit:
The speaker picked up lots of background, and the tunneling effect was too low to hear. An oscilloscope was used later to pick up lower frequencies, but there was lots of background on that as well. The tunneling was likely the noise on the oscillosope reading.
