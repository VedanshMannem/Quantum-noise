## 11/7/2025 2:01 PM - Learning + figuring out the circuit  

Some research + calculations on Zener diodes:

**What is a Zener diode:**
A Zener diode is different from a normal diode because of its breakdown voltage when its reversed. There's a Zener breakdown region where when the voltage ran through is really close to the voltage its rated for (Zener diode was rated for 5.1V and ~4.9-5.2V was used), then there are quantum tunneling effects. Zener diodes are doped very specifically to create a thin barrier where quantum tunneling is possible. Physically speaking, the diode was tunneling at the input voltage, and that's what the oscilloscope was picking up, but it was hard to observe because of the background. 

Found cheap Zener diodes and ran calculations on required voltages:
- 9V battery (easiest, but there's other stuff)
- need noise amplifier
- a speaker to connect (don't have aux cable)
- required diode: 5.1V zener

physics: 
Reverse biased diodes usually break, but zener can act as voltage regulators. When the input voltage is close to the voltage its rated for, quantum tunneling happens (zener are doped specifically for thinner barrier and that allows for tunneling)

## 11/7/2025 2:43 PM - Ordered parts + figured out circuit wiring  

Researched more stuff + ordered parts

Bought the following stuff:
1. [Zener Diode](https://www.amazon.com/AEDIKO-Value-140pcs-Diodes-Assortment/dp/B0BG829P7F/ref=sr_1_10?crid=2RXG1VDSYLBJH&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.QuvZqeFyzT6tu4x3VRU9nE7GmwReoMj4pVU80pwOn2ZtSq5HrlHHUqWv8C6Jgan1kRD-rP9ZkJpJNMcQPY0aTLkLS1jEd-cgqUI6eRjCCG3fRkmmJE0DMnhljtPX3-qjYihlv-I2BKlZWiaogNzRf5VjX7NAaO6IjVJiNn4-q_fJu2RknA8HTuB9wgpWnZxGzzJLZW-g9HjDIvQxRm0uYLmU739kvrmMNRjIx0RntEU.ZZa1mZUmgpnRuxndk-BTmx0llKFPpRgktbyRSEYj8Mo&dib_tag=se&keywords=zener%2Bdiode%2B5.1v&qid=1762219359&refinements=p_36%3A500-1500&rnid=2661611011&sprefix=zener%2Bdiode%2B5.1v%2Caps%2C252&sr=8-10&th=1)
2. [Speaker](https://www.amazon.com/Speaker-Speakers-Compatible-Loudspeaker-Player/dp/B0C49TKSQQ?th=1)
3. [Amplifier Module](https://www.amazon.com/QEBIDUM-Audio-Amplifier-Module-LM386/dp/B091FN2GBW)

Basically just bought stuff and learned more stuff about how to amplify the sound that the diode creates.
